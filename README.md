# RthTweaks

A plugin that add various content into your game
designed for Minecraft Spigot 1.17

iTrooz's Library plugin (https://github.com/iTrooz/Libraries) is requiered.

(forked because i was too lasy to copy back some of my old base code)
(if you look at it, the project is dead, sorry)

## Features
Here is the list of the features currently implemented (may be untested because im a bug magnet so i must take a full day to debug things)

### Custom Arrows
####Blazing arrow
A new powerful type of arrow made from blaze rods. The result is a... quite blazing... arrow !

For monkey brains out there:
- It's like Flame II when hit by it
- It create a explosion of flames on impact (but will not break blocks)
- Has flame particles and is glowy because how do you think you can recognize this when it's in the sky ?

Craft : Work in progress

####Phantom arrow
An arrow that uses phantom membrane as fletching. When fired at full power, it will not be affected by gravity.
But, when the speed is too low, or a block is hit, it will disappear. 

(A custom enchantment giving your arrow twice the velocity is coming later)
