# RthTweaks

A plugin that add various content into your game
designed for Minecraft Spigot 1.17

(forked because i was too lasy to copy back some of my old base code)
(if you look at it, the project is dead, sorry)

## Features
Here is the list of the features currently implemented (may be untested because im a bug magnet so i must take a full day to debug things)

### Blazing Arrows
A new powerful type of arrow made from blaze rods. The result is a... quite blazing... arrow !

For monkey brains out there, it is like :
- Having Flame II on your bow (but it's not enchanted)
- It create a explosion of flames on impact (but will not break blocks)
- Has flame particles because how do you think you can recognize this when it's in the sky ?

Craft : Work in progress

### Thirst
I like my game with a little bit of spice.

(Work in progress)
